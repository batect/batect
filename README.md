**b**uild **a**nd **t**esting **e**nvironments as **c**ode **t**ool: Dockerised build and testing environments made easy

## The sales pitch

* Consistent, fast, repeatable, isolated builds and test runs everywhere: your computer, your colleagues' computers and on CI
* Manage dependencies for integration and end-to-end testing with ease
* No installation required, only dependencies are Bash, Docker (v17.06+) and `curl`
  * onboard new team members in minutes
* Works with any language or framework, your existing CI system, and your chosen language's existing tooling
* Take advantage of existing Docker images to get started quickly
* Document and share common tasks within your team in a structured way - it's a
  [go script](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/praise-go-script-part-i) based on Docker

\* at the moment, a JVM is also required, but this requirement will be removed before v1.0
