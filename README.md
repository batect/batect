**b**uild **a**nd **t**esting **e**nvironments as **c**ode **t**ool: Dockerised build and testing environments made easy

## The sales pitch

* Consistent, fast, repeatable, isolated builds and test runs everywhere: your computer, your colleagues' computers and on CI
* Document and share common tasks within your team in a structured way - it's a
  [go script](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/praise-go-script-part-i) based on Docker
* Manage dependencies for integration and end-to-end testing (like databases) with ease
* Onboard new team members in minutes: no installation required
* Supports Linux, OS X and Windows
* Works with any language or framework, your existing CI system, and your chosen language's existing tooling
* Take advantage of existing Docker images to get started quickly

## Getting started

1. Drop the latest `batect` and `batect.cmd` scripts from the [releases page](https://github.com/batect/batect/releases)
   into the root folder of your project.
2. If you're on Linux or OS X, make sure the script is executable: run `chmod +x batect`.
3. Create your `batect.yml` to define your environment:
    * Take a look at the [sample projects](https://batect.dev/SampleProjects.html) for inspiration
    * Dive straight into [the configuration file reference](https://batect.dev/config/Overview.html)
    * Or, if you're using another tool already and want to switch to batect,
      [batectify](https://batectify.enchanting.dev/) by [@ineffyble](https://github.com/ineffyble) can convert files from
      other tools to batect's format

## System requirements

batect requires Docker 18.03.1 or newer, Java 8 or newer (although this requirement will be removed before v1.0), and:

* On Linux and OS X: Bash and `curl`
* On Windows: Windows 10

batect supports both Linux and Windows containers.
