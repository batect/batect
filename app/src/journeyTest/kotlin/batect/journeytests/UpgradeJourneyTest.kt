// What's the point of this test?
// We assume that the unit tests are enough to ensure that the upgrade process works correctly.
// (If that changes in the future, we could start batect with the wrapper, point it at a fake download
// server and test that the upgrade works correctly.)
// This test just ensures that Kodein is configured correctly for the upgrade command, which can't be (easily)
// checked with a unit test.
