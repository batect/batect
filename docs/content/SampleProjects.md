* [batect-sample-java](https://github.com/batect/batect-sample-java): demonstrates a setup for Java, Gradle, Travis CI and pushing images to Docker Hub
* [batect-sample-python](https://github.com/sbalnojan/batect-sample-python): demonstrates a setup for Python
* [batect-sample-ruby](https://github.com/batect/batect-sample-ruby): demonstrates a setup for Ruby and Travis CI

The batect codebase itself also contains [an example of running both Elasticsearch and Kibana](https://github.com/batect/batect/tree/master/tools/logViewer)
(this is used to view and query log files generated at runtime by batect).
