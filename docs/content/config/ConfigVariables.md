# Config variables

!!! note
    This page reflects the options available in the [most recent version](https://github.com/batect/batect/releases/latest)
    of batect.

Config variables allow you simplify your configuration file, and document and codify the different options available to a developer using your tasks.

They are useful for a number of use cases:

* Reducing duplication in configuration files
* Simplifying management of developer-specific preferences (eg. a developer's preferred log output level)
* Simplifying management of sets of environment-specific settings (eg. managing sets of test environment connection settings for a CI server)

Config variables can be used anywhere [expressions](Expressions.md) are supported. Reference config variables with the syntax `<name` or `<{name}`.

## Values

Values for config variables are taken from the following sources, with higher values taking precedence:

* a value provided on the command line with [`--config-var <name>=<value>`](../CLIReference.md#set-a-config-variable-config-var)
* a value specified in a config variables file, either the default `batect.local.yml` or specified with [`--config-vars-file`](../CLIReference.md#set-config-variables-from-a-file-config-vars-file)
* the default value

If a variable is referenced but no value is available for it, an error occurs.

## Built-in config variables

There is one built-in config variable:

### `batect.project_directory`
Contains the full path to the directory containing the root configuration file in use.

Normally, this is the directory containing `batect.yml` unless the configuration file has been overridden with the
[`--config-file` / `-f` command line option](../CLIReference.md#use-a-non-standard-configuration-file-name-config-file-or-f).

This is particularly useful in configuration files imported into the project with `include`. For example, if `/my-project/a.yml` contains:

```yaml
include:
  - includes/b.yml
```

And `/my-project/includes/b.yml` contains:

```yaml
containers:
  my-container:
    image: alpine:1.2.3
    volumes:
      - local: <{batect.project_directory}/scripts
        container: /code/scripts
```

Then the directory `/my-project/scripts` will be mounted into the `my-container` container at `/code/scripts`.

## Definition

Each config variable definition is made up of:

### `description`

A human-readable description of the variable.

### `default`

The default value of the variable.

## Examples

### Config variable with no description or default value

```yaml
config_variables:
  log_level: {}
```

`{}` is the YAML syntax for an empty object.

### Config variable with description and default value

```yaml
config_variables:
  log_level:
    description: Log level to use for application
    default: debug
```
