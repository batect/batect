# Introduction

## What is batect?

batect allows you to define your development tasks (building, running, testing, linting and more) in terms of one or more
Docker containers, run those tasks quickly and consistently everywhere, and easily share them with your team.

batect is:

* :rocket: **fast**: Tasks start quickly due to parallelisation, run quickly thanks to caching, and clean up reliably every time - we've
  seen 17% quicker execution than Docker Compose.

* :relieved: **easy to use**: Easily share your development tasks with your whole team, and free them from manual setup of build tools and dependencies
  for tasks like running your app locally or integration testing. And no installation is required either - just drop the script in your
  project and batect takes care of the rest.

* :sparkles: **consistent**: batect uses Docker to create a clean, isolated environment every time you run a task, freeing you from "works on my machine"
  issues - including on CI. And you can easily share tasks between projects with bundles.

* :white_check_mark: **versatile**: Anything that can run in a Docker container can be run with batect - builds, unit testing, integration testing, linting,
  local environments, deployments; frontend, backend or somewhere in between, batect can do it all.

## What is batect not?

* a build tool - instead, use your chosen language's existing tooling (eg. Gradle, Rake, CMake or Cargo) from within a batect task
* a deployment tool - instead, use your target environment's existing tooling (eg. kubectl) from within a batect task
* a CI tool - instead, use your existing CI tool and have it run batect

## What are batect's system requirements?

batect requires Docker 18.03.1 or newer, Java 8 or newer (although this requirement will be removed before v1.0), and:

* On Linux and macOS: Bash and `curl`
* On Windows: Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016 or later

batect supports both Linux and Windows containers.

A 64-bit version of Java is required on Windows.

## I'm sold! How do I get started?

Take a look at [the setup instructions](Setup.md).

## What's going on under the hood?

Take a look at [the task lifecycle](TaskLifecycle.md) to understand how batect executes tasks.

## Why would I use batect?

Every application has a build environment - the tools and configuration needed to take the source code and produce an artifact
ready for use.

However, setting this up can be time consuming and frustrating. Too often new team members' first experience on
a project is a few days working out which tools they need to install, and another few days of then discovering the magic
combination of tool versions that will happily coexist. And as the application evolves and changes over time, maintaining and
updating this environment across all developers' machines and CI agents can be incredibly painful.

Similarly, most applications have external dependencies - for example, other services, databases, caches, credential storage
systems... the list is endless. Because of this, we would like to run integration, component or journey tests where the
application itself (or some part of it) interacts with these external dependencies.

In some cases, we'd like to use a real instance of it (eg. a running Postgres instance), and in other cases, we'd like to use a
fake (eg. a fake implementation of a downstream service). Either way, installing, configuring and managing all these dependencies
takes a lot of work, and making sure they're in a known state before a test run is key to reducing test flakiness. Add in networking
gremlins, different operating systems, personal preferences, built-up cruft and manual configuration and you end up with an enormous
number of variables that lead to a huge amount of wasted time spent debugging issues that are entirely preventable.

batect helps solve these problems by:

* allowing you to entirely automate the setup of your build and testing environments
* storing this automation alongside your application code, so that it is versioned and updated just like any other part of
  your application
* ensuring that every single command invocation starts with a completely fresh environment based on your configuration file,
  making it impossible to get out-of-sync from the desired state
* providing an easy mechanism for developers to discover what tasks are available: `./batect --list-tasks`
* making use of Docker to do all of this in an isolated and low-overhead way
* using some smart dependency management logic, parallelism and Docker's caching features to do all of this very, very quickly
* taking advantage of Docker's networking features to set up an isolated network for every command
* enabling you to use existing Docker images as-is (or easily use custom Dockerfiles) to quickly get up and running
