# Shell tab completion

Shell tab completion makes it faster to work with batect. Rather than having to remember [CLI options](../CLIReference.md) or task names, you can type the
start of the name, press ++tab++, and the name will be filled in for you automatically.

!!! info "More coming soon"
    Shell tab completion is a new feature with support for a limited set of shells. Support for other shells such as Bash and zsh will be added soon.

    Follow issue [#116](https://github.com/batect/batect/issues/116) to be notified of new releases.
